\title{Extract profiles from surface using multiple segments}
\usage{
x3p_extract_profile_segments(
  x3p,
  width,
  col = "#FF0000",
  linewidth = 11,
  scale_to = NA,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x3p}{object}

\item{width}{segment width}

\item{col}{color}

\item{linewidth}{integer value specifying the width for the profile}

\item{scale_to}{positive number indicating the resolution for the line returned.}

\item{verbose}{logical}
}
\value{
x3p object with added \code{lines} attribute.
}
\description{
The 3d topographic surface is split into multiple segments of width \code{width} (in pixels)
using an overlap of 10\% between segments. For each segment, a line is extracted (with \code{x3p_extract_profile}).
Line segments are projected onto the mask of the initial x3p object and exported as a \code{lines} attribute.

\examples{
logo <- x3p_read(system.file("csafe-logo.x3p", package="x3ptools"))
logo <- x3p_m_to_mum(logo)
