\description{
\code{image.x3p} expands the generic image method for x3p objects.
This image function creates a raster image to show the surface of an x3p file.
Due to some inconsistency in the mapping of the origin (0,0), (choice between top left or bottom left)  image functions from different packages will result in different images.

logo <- x3p_read(system.file("csafe-logo.x3p", package="x3ptools"))
image(logo)
