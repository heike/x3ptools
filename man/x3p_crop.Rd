}
\arguments{
\item{x3p}{x3p object}

\item{x}{integer, location (in pixels) of the leftmost side of the rectangle,}

\item{y}{integer, location (in pixels) of the leftmost side of the rectangle,}

\item{width}{integer, width (in pixels) of the rectangle,}

\item{height}{integer, height (in pixels) of the rectangle,}
}
\value{
x3p object of the cropped location expanded by list element \code{offset} that contains the coordinates of the cropped piece within the parent.
}

logo <- x3p_read(system.file("csafe-logo.x3p", package="x3ptools"))

logo_only <- x3p_crop(logo, x=20, y=50, width = 255 ,height =510)
# x3p_image(logo_only, size=c(500,500), zoom = 1)
